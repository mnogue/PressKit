# Catsoft Studios

Catsoft Studios was born from the need of creating and expressing new and rewarding experiences through digital media. It is a one-man army company commited to create top quality products with a clear mind set towards innovation. Specially, but not limited , on the interactive entertainment field.

## Our Story

Before I started Catsoft Studios, I was working on a cloud gaming start-up called LudiumLab. We had a state of the art technology that allowed the users to play AAA games in almost any device that had an internet connection.

In July of 2014, the business went bankrupt and closed its doors. I had some projects in mind and it seemed that it was the time to carry them on. I created a plugin for Unity called SImple Gesture, which enabled developers to easly detect finger gestures on touch-screen devices with just one line of code.

I created an Android demo and it was very well recieved by the community. People really liked the idea of being able to control a character by drawing gestures on the screen, instead of pressing virtual buttons. That's when I thought of making a real game using the plugin I just had created. Despite the limited resources I had, I was confident that my programming and design skills would be enough to transform this idea into a video-game.

And so was born Mobius of Magic, launched on the 8th of August of 2015.

# Projects

Catsoft Studios started its journey in 2014. The following lines showcase some of our latest works.

## Mobius of Magic

Mobius of Magic is an old-school RPG designed exclusively for touch-screen devices. The combat system is a unique mix between the turn-based titles of the PlayStation X generation (Final Fantasy VII - IX, Dragon Ques, ...) and the new interaction capabilities mobile devices.

## Simple Gesture

Simple Gesture is a powerful, yet easy to use, gesture recognizer for touch interface devices that allows you to focus on your current project, instead of struggling with the implementation of gesture recognition algorithms.

``` cs
Gesture.OnSwipeRight(this.DetectedSwipeRight);

public void DetectedSwipeRight() {
    Debug.Log("The player has swiped right!");
}
```

It is as simple as subscribing a `method` to the desired gesture and this method will be `triggered` every time the gesture is detected.
