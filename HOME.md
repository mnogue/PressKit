## Our Story

Before I started Catsoft Studios, I was working on a cloud gaming start-up called [LudiumLab](http://ludiumlab.com). We had a state of the art technology that allowed the users to play AAA games in almost any device that had an internet connection.

In July of 2014, the business went bankrupt and closed its doors. I had some projects in mind and it seemed that it was the time to carry them on. I created a plugin for Unity called SImple Gesture, which enabled developers to easly detect finger gestures on touch-screen devices with just one line of code.

I created an Android demo and it was very well recieved by the community. People really liked the idea of being able to control a character by drawing gestures on the screen, instead of pressing virtual buttons. That's when I thought of making a real game using the plugin I just had created. Despite the limited resources I had, I was confident that my programming and design skills would be enough to transform this idea into a video-game.

And so was born **Mobius of Magic**, launched on the 8th of August of 2015.

# Projects

Catsoft Studios started its journey in 2014. The following lines showcase some of our latest works.

## Aaargh! My cats!

This project is still in development and thus we can't give much information about it. But we can assure we're putting all of our resources to create a top quality game for mobile devices. Stay tuned on our **Twitter** account for more information!

The story begins at the **Harbour of Thal'mur**, one of the regions of the world of **Everwind**. After being training your sorcery skills with your master **Roku**, he decides it is time for you to take your final test. Once you have reviewd the basics of spell casting, **Roku** sends you to run an errand for **Leena**, the **White Mistress**. Your master gives you the **Dragon Fang**, an ancient relic known to have mystical powers. Unaware of the importance of this artifact, you embark on an epic adventure that will lead you from the greatest cities to the darkest regions of the world.

## Simple Gesture

Simple Gesture is a powerful, yet easy to use, gesture recognizer for touch interface devices that allows you to focus on your current project, instead of struggling with the implementation of gesture recognition algorithms.

Using **Simple Gesture** is as easy as subscribing a method to the desired gesture. For example, if we want to detect when the user performs a swipe to the right side of the screen, we just need to subscribe a custom method (ie: `DetectedSwipeRight`) to the `OnSwipeRight` method of the `SimpleGesture` class. *VoliÃ¡*

``` cs
Gesture.OnSwipeRight(this.DetectedSwipeRight);

public void DetectedSwipeRight() {
    Debug.Log("The player has swiped right!");
}
```
