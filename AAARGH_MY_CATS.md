## Story

Once upon a time, beyond the Mystic Sea and the Mountains of Fire, there was an inn called... The Horned Beer! There, lived our hero... Wulfern! A warrior who once fought a thousand and one battles! Who now lives retired... Happily with his furry friends.

Our story begins on a night of a full moon. While Wulfern sleeps tight, a bunch of shadows enter his house to steal his most precious treasures...
